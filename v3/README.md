my personal tweakity stuff for [Vorapis 2013](https://vorapis.pages.dev), published for others to use!

### semi-better theater mode [[userstyle]](https://github.com/macimas/stylin/raw/main/v3/semi-better_theater_mode/v3.user.css)
an attempt to make theater mode act more like in modern YouTube
<br>
somewhat configurable

it also works with StarTube at least when i tried it with most layouts, altho i don't really use it `:p`

### semi-better vordebugger [[userstyle]](https://github.com/macimas/stylin/raw/main/v3/semi-better_vordebugger/v3.user.css)
an attempt to improve the vordebugger, with my personal preference
<br>
it's a bit iffy, but should be good enough (for me at the very least)

### clear button for search bar [[userscript]](https://github.com/macimas/stylin/raw/main/v3/clear%20button%20for%20search%20bar.user.js)
probably dirty attempt to add a button to clear search bar
<br>
it works most of the time
